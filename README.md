1. Extracts the information contained in the PDF files and in the spreadsheet.
2. Organizes in a list the common information between the PDFs and the spreadsheet.
3. Highlights in green the cells in the spreadsheet that match the data in the list.
4. Generates a summary based on the set operations performed between the data in the documents and the spreadsheet.
